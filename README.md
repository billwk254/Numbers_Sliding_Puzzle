## Description
The game starts up by showing an example of how a solved puzzle looks like then after the user presses "enter" it generates a puzzle for the player to solve. The player moves the pieces around using the "W,A,S,D" keys.The game will intuitively show which moves are legal and display the keys that can be pressed in that situation.If a move is illegal, the key to that move will not be displayed on the screen. Once the user moves each number piece to its corresponding position the game congratulates the player for successfully completing the puzzle.
